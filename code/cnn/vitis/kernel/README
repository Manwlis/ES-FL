#### Set HLS solution settings from Vitis IDE
Copy file with settings *hls_run_pre.tcl* to:
Explorer >  system > kernels > Emulation-SW / Emulation-HW / HW folders

Go to: Assistant > Settings... > system > kernels > Emulation-SW / Emulation-HW / HW > cnn_accelerator
Add to V++ configuration settings:
```
[hls]
pre_tcl=./hls_run_pre.tcl
```

#### Set target clock speed of the synthesized kernel
Go to: Assistant > Settings... > system > kernels > Emulation-SW / Emulation-HW / HW > cnn_accelerator
Add to V++ configuration settings:
```
[hls]
clock=240000000:cnn_accelerator
```

#### Link a clock to a kernel
Assistant > Settings... > system > system_hw_link > Emulation-SW / Emulation-HW / HW > binary_container_1
Add to V++ configuration settings:
```
[clock]
freqHz=240000000:cnn_accelerator_1
```

#### Important: Host applications using the XRT native API must be compiled with -std=c++17.
